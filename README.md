# Text Summarizer

With the ever-increasing volume of textual data available on the internet, it has become
increasingly difficult and time-consuming for people to read and comprehend all of it. Therefore,
there is a growing need for automated systems that can effectively summarize large volumes of
text. Text summarization using NLP is one such solution that can help users quickly understand
the key ideas and information contained within a large text document. However, despite the
advancements in NLP, text summarization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of
natural language and the variability in the structure of text. Therefore, the problem statement is
to develop an accurate and efficient text summarization system that can generate concise and
informative summaries while preserving the key ideas and context of the original text. This
system should be able to handle different types of text data and produce summaries that are
suitable for different purposes and audiences. The system should also be able to evaluate the
quality of the summaries and provide feedback for improvement.
